                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Mahanadi Club, a cornerstone of Sambalpur's social and cultural life for over a century. Established in 1896, the club has evolved from modest beginnings to become the preferred retreat for the city’s elite—whether from the business community or the distinguished ranks of the district’s officers.</p>
                <p>Our club is more than just a gathering place; it's a sanctuary where members can unwind, connect, and rejuvenate. The club offers an array of top-tier facilities, including a Tennis Court, an Indoor Badminton Court, Billiards, and a beautifully maintained Lush Green Lawn, all designed to cater to your recreational needs. The well-equipped Bar, serving a fine selection of drinks and snacks, further enhances the experience, providing the perfect setting for relaxation and socializing.</p>
                <p>Spread across approximately 4.0 acres in the heart of Sambalpur, the Mahanadi Club is a green oasis in the city. The expansive open spaces and mature trees provide a serene environment, allowing members to immerse themselves in the beauty of nature while enjoying the convenience of a central location. This prime setting ensures easy access for all our members, making the club a hub of activity and a place of refuge from the stresses of daily life.</p>
                <p>In addition to our local offerings, Mahanadi Club boasts affiliations with prestigious clubs across the country, including the Bhubaneswar Club in Bhubaneswar. These partnerships allow our members to enjoy reciprocal privileges and access to facilities nationwide, extending the reach and benefits of their membership beyond Sambalpur.</p>
                <p>At Mahanadi Club, we pride ourselves on being more than just a club; we are a community, a tradition, and a part of Sambalpur’s rich history. We look forward to welcoming you to experience all that our club has to offer.</p>
